<u>Study Questions to think about:&nbsp;</u> 
1\. What does Nietzsche mean when he/his madman says "God is dead"? Is he literally talking about a God who has died?
2\. What is the full significance of the death of God?
3\. Nietzsche writing in the 19th century says the significance of the death of God has not fully reached us. Would he still say this if he was living today?

#### Additional Resources
The lecture below gives a more detailed account of Nietzsche on nihilism. It repeats a fair bit of the materials in the lectures for this week but goes beyond them and includes a Q&A session
