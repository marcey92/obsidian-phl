- **Week 1**: Terminology and scepticism
	- **Terminology**
		- **Epistemic**: relating to knowledge
		- **Doxastic**: relating to belief
		- **Belief**: What we think is true
		- **True belief**: When what we believe is true
		- **Knowledge**: When we are justified in our beliefs
		- **Foundational**: When there is an axiom to our knowledge
		- **Coherentist**: We only think what is true, is what makes sense to other things that we think are true
		- **A priori**: Something that is true without empirical evidence
	- Why is epistemology important?
		- If we want to make change in the world we need to have a good representation of it
		- We need theory about the world, to make practical changes
		- We need good reasons for the practical changes we mak
	- **General concepts**
		- We believe what we think is true, this never changes
		- What we think is true, does change
	- Descartes
		- **Funnel for modern thoughts**: Themes in philosophy are re-organised, are more appealing to the modern audience, by being based on science
		- **Question for the modern world**: How to reconstruct our knowledge of the world?
	- Scepticism
		- All we can know is that there is perception / experience
- **Week 2**: What could knowledge be and JTB
	- We can ask:
		- What can i know
		- What is knowledge
	- What is knowledge in other words is:
		- Conceptual analysis
		- Explication
	- Conceptual analysis can be decided into 
		1. How is the concept of knowledge used
		2. What could knowledge be
	- JTB attempts to clarify what knowledge could be
	- JTB problem
		- knowledge vs justified,
		- If they differ in meaning then an example can be used to break it
		- If they are the same then we can never have knowledge, and just be justified
- **Week 3**: What can we be justified to believe? iInternalism and Externalism
	- Justification leads us to
		- Internalism
		- Externalism
	- Problems with interpretation of justification, does it include truth
