- **Week 1**: Introduces the three main ethical systems and some key arguments for and agains
	- **Overview**
	- **Terminology**
		- **Well being**: Personal good / utility
		- **Utility**: Usefulnesses to us
		- **First order debate**: What things are good
		- **Second order debate**: Why are some things good
		- **Finality**: Ultimate goal / foundational thing
		- **Centrality** Without it, life can not be good
		- **Prudence** Doing without what it is said to be good for us
		- **Gerrymandering** Deliberate manipulation to cause a particular outcome 
	- Ethical Systems
		- Hedonism
			- **Simple**: Something is good for us if and only if it gives us pleasure
			- **General clarification**: Over our life time, not just in the moment
		- Desire 
			- **Simple**: Something is good for us if and only if it gets us what we want
			- **General clarification**: 
				- Over our life time, not juts in the moment
				- If we not confused, ignorant or self-defeating about what we want
		- Objective 
			- **Simple**: There is a list of things that are just good in and of themselves
	- General concerns
		- **Personal**: What is it we as an individual aim for / should aim for?
		- **Practical**: How can we measure how good our life is?
		- **Ethical**: How does what is good relate to other things: motives, outcomes, principles, rights, duties etc. 
		- **Meta-ethics**: What is our place in the universe? Basically is there such thing as an ethical life, and if so how do we know that?
			- *God? Common good? Evolution? Programming? Society?*
	- Debates are divided twice
		- *A is good because it is objectively good*
		- *A is good because it gives us B (subjective)*
		- *There may be many things which are good*
		- *There may be many reasons for why something is good*
		- **What** is good, and **why** is what is good, good?
		- What is **subjectively** good, and **objectively** good?
			- *Something is good only if it makes us happy, vs something is good because it just is good*
	- Hedonism
		- In favour
			1. We apear to behave in this way (Disposition)
			2. It is behind all our actions (Finality)
			3. Without it, can a life be good? (Centrality)
			4. If anything is good, surely it is pleasure? (Necessity - what is necessarily good)
			5. It’s easy to know if something is pleasurable (Verifiable)
		- Against
			1. We don’t always do what is pleasurable? (Prudence)
				- CA: But we do to maximise pleasure over our whole life
			2. It depends on the situation, so it seems there is something else that we want (Context)
			3. Somethings that are always pleasurable, are just not good (Content)
			4. We may want things that give us no pleasure, like everyone in Mexico having a good birthday (dogmatic)
	- Desire
		- In favour
			- We may want many different things, real pleasure vs fake
			- Without getting anything we want, can life be good? (Centrality)
			- All our actions are guided by it (Finality)
			- It shows us our preferences and values (Verification & useful)
		- Against
			- We can be confused about what we want
				- CA: We can / need to remove confusion
					- CA2: To what point should we remove confusion, who decides that?
			- We don’t always go for what we want in all situations (Prudence)
				- CA: But we do to maximise what we want over our life
			- What if we want something which seems to give us or anyone any personal good? (Content)
				- Pigeons on the mood
				- Life to exist in a different universe
			- It’s easy to move the goal posts because the list of what we want is predetermined by each attempt to improve the theory
	- Objective list
		- In favour
			- It’s seems obvious that some things to us just are good (self-evident)
			- We like to aim for what we think is good for us, instead of just what we want (default)
	- Questions raised:
		- What is to stop one person desiring pleasure and the other what they want?
		- Objective list must depend on something else, as in because we are human, but then what is it about humans that makes this list good?
		- How useful are our intuitions for finding what is good? Surely we must be able to say why something is good
- **Week 2**: Looks at the main devision between modern ethics
	- **Terminology**
		- **Consequentialist**: There is a good that we should maximise through our actions
		- **Deontologist**: There is not some sort of good that we should maximise just through our actions
	- **Two questions for a consequentialist**
		1. What is the good?
		2. How do we bring it about?
	- **Theory of the …**
		- Good
		- Right
	- **Complexity arrises** from when we may need to do something that will harm the good to maximise it in the long term
	- **Solutions for the complexity** distinguish the type of consequentialists 
	- **Advantages of consequentialist**
		- The self is not centred 
		- everyone has an equal weight
	- **Objections**
		1. How do we distinguish the good?
		2. Dirty hands
		3. Demandingness
		4. Alienatinon (from our norms)
		5. Self-defeating (if it’s not the decision critiera)
	- **Rules added to consequentialism**
		- Thinking if everyone did this action
		- If this good isn’t being maximise, at least this other good is
		- Not a guidance method
- **Week 3**: Looks at how we should decide between right and wrong actions, especially when the impact others
	- **Constraints**: Do not kill 
	- **Permissions**: You may kill
	- **We are led to think of them because …**
		- What are the decision criteria for maximising the good
		- Making sense of disagreements in how we should act
		- Rationalising right actions
	- **Double effect**: Our actions have intent and foreseen 
		- Intent:
			- The end in itself
			- Means to an end
		- Forseen
			- Unintended consequences
	- **Doing & Allowing**: We way up what we should do, and what we can allow
		- Doing:
			- Do not kill
			- Do save
		- Allowing:
			- Non-interfering 
			- Not my problem
		- Doing can be decided into positive and negative duties
			- Do save
			- Do kill
	- **Rights and Threats**
		- An action is allwoed if it does not create new threats and does not infringe on someone’s rights
	- **Thought experiments**
		- Used to test simple changes and our reaction to them
		- Can help prove and disprove a point
		- Careful because an outcome is usually presupposed
