A difficult work that uses a llexicon to try and use phenomenology to understand being. What I mean by that is that by looking closely at our experience, what we sense, and making sense of it, we can then grasp what is real within it. We have a particular way of viewing the world, created by our care for ourselves, and the particular ways we can do that, partly as a response to ourselves and in part to the world we find ourselves in. The lexicon is of great importance, as it is meant to help us see beyond the conditioned view we have, which can be traced back to the Greeks. A object subject relationship, probably best seen in Descartes. The mind body problem. The appearance and reality problem. A limiting way of viewing the world that is yet product of how we view the world, as in how from a primordial view of the world our current world is built up onto it.

- The method:
	- **Phenomonolgy**: The study of how we conceive of phenomena, that which we experience / encounter is to be the way in which we describe Dasien.

When we have a system that is self suffiecient or self consistent, we can be confident in our understanding. So in some sense we give being to things, the types of ways in which we see things gives being to those ways of seeing.. as in by seeing something it is being. But we should be able to make sense of what has being, that is not just our senses. That which we can say is real, or truly exists. 

So the lexicon that is meant to help us:

- **Meaning**: Meaning, as in the usefulness for something else, is what gives some types of being.
- **Care**: We are concerned that things should be a particular way
- **Dasein**: The thing that we can be sure has being. It’s being is a product of it caring about it’s own being. A human might have Dasien, but probably is not the only thing that does. To have Dasien is to have a *mineness*. It is from here that the being of other things can be investigated.
- **Worldhood**:  
- **average everydayness**:
- **present-at-hand**:
- **worldless**:
- ****
