###### How Conee and Feldman characterize their view of internalism? How does it differ from 'access internalism' 

Thier view of internalise is that the justification for a belief is linked to the mental state, events and conditions of the persons mins. Meaning a change in justification necessitates a change in the mind, a change in a set of properties in the mind that a justification relies on will change the strength of means of justification.

Access internalism states that what justifies a persons belief is something that they have special access to, this does not necessitate that the justification is dependant on the persons mind. The justification may be some external fact they have the potential to access. 

An internalist view like that of Connie and Feldman would say that the external fact is not a justification as it is not internal, only after the fact is acquainted is it valid evidence. 

###### What are Goldman's objections involving 'stored belief' and 'forgotten evidence' cases? How do Conee and Feldman respond?

Goldman objects to internalist with stored belief by saying that stored belief is something external to the mind.

In Goldman’s case of forgotten evidence the premise is that S is justified in her belief even though the source of the belief is forgotten or misremembered. 
In the case of forgotten the response is that:
1. S may be justified because of the quality of the memory, it is vivacious
2. S may not be justified because of the quality of the memory, it is weak
3. S is justified if she has supporting evidence even if her original evidence is forgotten
4. S is not justified if she has no supporting evidence
In the case of misremembered
1. S may not have knowledge, but my be on her way to knowledge
2. Gettier case
	1. S has accidentally got true justified belief but not knowledge because S forgot the denier
	2. If S had not forgotten, she would not believe in that case.. therefore the internal view holds true
	3. 
###### How well does Conee and Feldman's account of internalism capture the intuitions that motivate internalism?

By focusing that it is what is internal to us, without any moral reasoning it frees internalise from the objection that the person must know in each case what justifies a belief. Stored beliefs and stored justifiers are also allowed. It prevents Goldman’s case of using time and conscious property as an attack. 

An external fact needs to be internalised for a justification to rely on it. I can’t see a problem with that. 

The intuitions are that two people have the same justification for their belief if they have the same internal state regardless of their surroundings. If one mistakenly does not see a fire, where one can not see a fire, they are both justified in believing there is no fire. Or if one mistakenly sees an assailant, when another does they are both as justified. Of course the one who mistakenly sees one may be aware that they are more nervous and prone to seeing an assailant, in that case the internal states are different… if they are unaware, perhaps it is outside anyones ability to know why we sometimes see things that arn’t there then surely they are both justified.
