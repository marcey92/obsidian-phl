Are some valued without regard to their instrumentation, while others can only be valued by their function?? 
- > People give others roles vs accepting roles given to them (GS)
- > Women vs men (GS)

A decadent culture would expel those who are thought of as currupting vs an individual who might suppress, disguise, remove through practice what is ugly in themselves.. how does that relate to a culture.. oppress, change, expel through force / corsion?

If it is our duty to be kind to those who are less than ourselves. to what extent can we enforce our will on them? Or only upwards?
