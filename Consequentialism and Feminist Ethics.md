**Todo:**
	- Go through the essay and pick out bits that are really important like I did with Descartes
		- , things that you have to cover to understand the essay / teach it
		- Feminism has criticised … for being to abstract
			- Points made
		- What’s wrong with Impartiality
		- Why impartiality is important
		- Partiality / Impartiality???
	- Look for any more arguments and counter arguments and add them to the list

- **Overview** A sophisticated consequentialist can meet feminist concerns (partiality) and the demands of impartial norms
- **Terminology**
	- **Consequentialism**: Theory that holds the right action to be the action that maximises the good
	- **Sophisticated consequentialism**:
	- **Instrumental**: Something that is used to achieve a good
	- **Contractarian**: Legitimacy of social rules are based on hypothetical contracts between people
	- **Voluntarist Contractarian** ?
	- **Contractarianism**: Second order concerns in Contract theory, ie what accounts for the agreements we make to maximise well being?
	- **Contracturalism**: First order concerns in Contract theory, ei what principles and agreements are made in fair and reasonable conditions?
- **Secondary Aims**
	1. Impartiality is good in some contexts
	2. Partiality is good in some contexts
	3. Consequentialism can account for our partial norms (social relationships)
	4. Partiality is good because some types of partiality are good for everyone
	5. Can a good life have special obligations?*
- **Arguments**
	1. Partiality is a norm in society
	2. Relationships are a source of good and happiness (core of feminist ethics)
	3. Relationships should not be excluded from ethics generally
		- Relationships have been excluded from ethics because ethics demands self-sufficiency
		- Self-sufficiency aims to increase control and reduce risk
		- Having control over ones actions is an implicit part of an ethical life ✅
		- Reducing risk by not having relationships is not an implicit part of an ethical life ❌
	4. An agent should not always consciously aim for the good to create the most good
		-  A character trait can systematically produce good
	5. A theory can be true, but it should not guide all actions 
	6. Angle of the world: Unmodified consequentialism in unappealing
	7. Angle of the world: Unmodified consequentialism does not create the most good
		- Unlimited demands should be resisted
		- Partiality is good in some situations (See argument #3)
	8.  As only a criterion of rightness for action, consequentialism can incorporate partiality into an ethical life 
- **Counter arguemnts**
	- Moral schizophrenia
- **Structure of essay**
	- Impartiality
	- Feminist ethics critiques impartiality
		- Nodding
		- Gilligan
	- Impartiality has a place in ethics

	- Future demands
		- Resisting demands to prevent future demands
- **Overview**
		- Criticism of Contractarianism
			- Nodding: Ethics are based on relationships as they create sentiments
			- Gilligan: Women do not view themselves in isolation, as men have tended to
		- Feminist focus on partially through their experiences
	- Importance of social relations
		1. Relationships are evidently good
		2. Alone we can not decide what is good
		3. Relationships maximise the common good
		4. In some contexts acting on our social impulses does does more good than acting with the common good in mind
	- Impartiality
		- In favour:
			- **Corrective**: Corrects biases and prejudices
		- Against
			- **Relations**: Requires forgoing friends and family
			- **Relations suffer**: Those closest to us suffer for the greater good
			- **Unlimited demands**: Maximising good is a never ending project
	- Self-sufficiency: 
		- Our wills are sufficient for identifying the correct actions
		- We can only be judged on what we can control
		- For:
			- **Control** We can only be judged on what we can control
			- **Risk** We can not control others
			- **Relations** We have less control with relations
		- Against:
			- 
	- Bernard Williams: An ethical life requires morals and good traits
		- Morality: Impartial, impersonal moral theory
		- Traits that are good: Self-perfection, personal project, goals, aspirations
	- Aristotle: An ethical life is one of intellectual contemplation
		- Intellectual contemplation is happiness itself 
		- Moral duty may require other activities so we give up a good when following moral duty
	- Kant: We should be cautious of relationships
		- Friendship is when the “moral good will unites them”
			- But what of parents?
	- Schopenhauer: No friends / relationships is best
		- “Great minds are life eagles, and build nests in lofty altitudes”
	- No friends / relationships is best
	- because it is removed from particular (mainly women’s) experiences
	
	- Feminist views:
		- Nodding: Ethics are based on relationships as they create sentiments
		- Gilligan: Women do not view themselves in isolation, as men have tended to
	- Criticism of Contract theory
		-  **Vulnerable**: There appear to be no contracts that govern our relationship with the vulnerable / those that can not make contracts?
		- **Norms**: It does not tell us what norms underly the agreements
		- **Relationships**: There is no accounting for how our concept of fairness is created through healthy relationships
	- Criticism of Voluntarist Contractarianism
		- Our obligations are due to bonds that may or may not be volentary
