- **Week 6**
	- **Politics** Social contract theory
		- Outside of political philosophy, we typically encounter politics by way of this question: Who do I want to govern me? One way into political philosophy is by way of a more fundamental question: "Why should there be a government in the first place?" Some have argued for the desirability of government by imagining its absence: A state of nature, wherein men and women live ungoverned. As we will learn this week, for Thomas Hobbes in particular, this wasn’t just some fanciful possibility.
		- **Text** [Hobbes, _Leviathan_ (Part I, Chapter 13)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d1t1mf1ea0i9ptn/Hobbes1996%283%29.pdf?dl=1)
			- Hobbes's famous treatment of the nature of political man and source of the state's authority was published on the heels of the Civil War (1642-1651), which had seen the execution of Charles I and exile of Charles II. Hobbes diagnosis of the war was that it had come about because fundamentalist religious forces, and especially Puritans, had challenged the king’s divine right to rule. The lesson he drew was that the only way to secure peace and stability - and to avoid the awful conditions in the 'state of nature,' where there is no overarching power to keep us all in check - therefore was to surrender to a strong, unquestioned sovereign. Hence, the Leviathan, named after the terrifying monster from the Hebrew Bible: “When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing. [...] Nothing on earth is his equal—a creature without fear" (Job 41: 1-34).  
		- **Text**[Locke, _Second Treatise of Government_ (Chapters 1-5)](http://vufind.lib.bbk.ac.uk/vufind/Record/424441).  
			- Like Hobbes, Locke was doing political philosophy in a manner deeply influenced by current events. Locke's _Two Treatises of Government_ was published shortly after the Glorious Revolution (1688), which had seen the replacement of James II by William III (William of Orange). Since Locke was a supporter of the latter, it raised a question for him: how can you legitimately remove a ruler? For Locke, the answer lies in the state's authority not flowing from the grimness of the alternative - while the state of nature to Locke was not a walk in the park, it was certainly less grim than in Hobbes - but rather from the consent of the ruled. Since that consent can be revoked when, as Locke put it, "the Legislative, or the Prince […] act contrary to their Trust" (§221). Thereby, the Hobbesian idea of a social contract with an awe-inspiring monster - surprisingly - becomes the germ for the modern, liberal idea that the state needs to justify itself to its subjects.
