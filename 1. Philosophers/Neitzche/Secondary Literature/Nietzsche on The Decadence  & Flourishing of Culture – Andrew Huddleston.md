#### Introduction
- N is a far more social creature than has been appreciated by the prevalent individualist reading.
- Young argues for a shared body of myth for cultural flourishing: eternal feminine?
- AH believes N doesn't give much value to this in his mature works
- AH + Young argue that the best cultures are like great art
- *AH will argue that cutlure = collective life of peoope understood as akin to a great work of art*
#### Overview
- Chapter 1
	- Culture gives humans existential coping.
	- Culture declines when not sucessful at this
- Chapter 2
	- AH looks at two historical events to show that N never gave up on cutural renewal
		- German romantics under slave the ideal
		- Frankfurt school in their criticism of society, looking at societies failures
	- Kauffman stressed anti-political individualsm and down played noxious kutterphilosophie / culture
	- Birth of Tragedy: A culture folouishes when it is successful in providing the set of existential support it's society needs
	- Culture (possibility of inner transformation) vs cultural philistines (consumerism or the best life has been though and said)
- Chapter 3
	- Culture != great individual
	- great individual != cutlure
	- Culture as well as great individuals are sources of value
	- Before 1888 N is not only concerned with culture
- Chapter 4
	- Culture not indipendant of great individuals & visa versa
	- Christianity is a malice AND a boon
	- Great individuals use bad culture to their advantage
- Chapter 5
	- N uses french term decadence for particular form of malady 
	- Macrocosm (culture) vs microcosm (individual)
		- > Is the individual a metaphore for culture? 
	- A decadent culture that forces out it's decadent individuals is a sign of decadent culture, a non-decadent / great culture would integrate the decedent individuals 
		- > Is this using the metaphore of an individual?!? 
		- > Could N be getting us to think about culture to focus on the individual?! Only using it as a tool, because ultimately great individuals overcome?!?!
	- Kulter vs Bilding
- Chapter 6
	- Slavery is the best form of life for some people. In other words the best that some people can do is work for a higher culture: quarrying, sweeping heethovens floor. 
		- Brings to mind JFK story of cleaner
	- Human dignity is not innate, instead each has a radically different type depending on their (> role or nature?)
		- > I might have interpreted this wrong
		- > Sliding scale of dignity!?
- Chapter 7
	- Nihilistic view: there is no value that has privilage, not even N
	- AH argues against the nihilistic view
		- > How does he? What evidence is there that N gives?
- Chapter 8
	- The values underpinning culture.
	- How N critiques society set apart from the impact it has which could be good or bad.
	- Culture or institutions can be evaluated by looking at the meaning it has in and of itself. 
	- This foreshadows and is the precursor to the Frankfurt school of thought (N most important philosophical legacy)
- Afterword
	- N is not interested in making up our own values. But some values might have a (intersubjectively) deeper legitimacy.
	- Broader supra-personal historical & cultural phenomena on which one could render an evaluative verdict.
